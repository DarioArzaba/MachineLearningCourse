The CMMI defines configuration managment as a discipline to manage the following:\n","\n","1. Physical and functional characteristics of a configuration element.\n","2. Control changes to configuration characteristics.\n","3. Register and log changes to the process or to the implementation status.\n","4. Verify that the implementation complies with the requirements.\n","\n","This technology is widely used in network configuration by acquiring and storing the configuration of the devices and servers into a record, this record can be then used to answer:\n","\n","1. Who can make changes?\n","2. What changes can be made?\n","3. What is the impact of the changes to the system?\n","4. When did changes occur?\n","5. Why were the changes made?\n","6.

De acuerdo al CMMI como debe ser la administración de configuración.\n","\n","***\n","\n","There are four fundamental configuration managment activities:\n","\n","1. Version Management: Coordination of development between multiple programmers.\n","2. System Integration: Define component versions in use to recreate each system version.\n","3. Bug Logging: Report bugs tracking assigments and progress.\n","4. Release Managment: Refers to the planning of new releases, functions and distribution.\n","\n","Version managment links components and system versions into the full system. Changes managment uses changes requests to link the latest system versions with their system release. Release managment links every system version to a system release.\n","\n","Configuration managment tools are usually classifiedn into individual support, project related support or business process support.\n","\n","* Single or individual support tools are sufficient for small organizations that don't develope significant variants of their main products.\n","    * Version Control: Track, document and store individual component condiguration such as source code and external docs. For example, GIT.\n","    * Build Managment: Compiling and linking executable versions of the code, advanced versions extract the code from version control carry out performance test, regression tests and produce detailed summaries. For example, Apache, Grafle, PyBuilder, Grunt or make.\n","    * Change Control: Tracking of requests and event notifications, for example status changes and goal achievements. For example, flowcharts, ADKAR, Force Field, Kotter's or Gantt.\n","* Project related support tools are used in workspace managment for teams and integrators. They support distributed development environments and are suitable for medium to large organizations. For example, Trello, Asana, Wrike, Monday, Zenkit or Teamwork.\n","* Business Process Support: Automation for workflow managment and responsabilities including simultaneous component control, data and life cycles. Used in large organizations for formal development such as certification requirmenents. For example, BPMApp, Kissflow, Bizagi or Processmaker.\n","\n","***\n","\n","**Activity 2**\n","\n","1.

Context Perspective: The system is seen like a black box, it's the starting point of the project, it shows its functionality and its often incomplete. Concerns include the specific context of the contents, how the context depends on the environment, the black box perspective and the need of a design object to represent the services. It can use Context Diagrams for structured analysis, for example with Gleek.\n","2. Composition Perspective: The system is described recursively, there is detailed information of the most elementary parts and it stablishes roles for grouping. Concerns include the structure of the design object, the most elementary parts and the roles of the parties. It can use UML diagrams for analysis.\n","3. Logic Perspective: The system is described as structural static relationships with implementations as classes and interfaces, it show the existing and the designed types. Concerns include the development and reuse of abstractions, implementations and expressions in terms of existing types. Class diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","4. Dependency Perspective: The system is described as entity relationships, it shows interconnections, entity access, information sharing, execution order and interface parametization. Concerns include a general overview of the design object, the impact of requirements, critical components, proritize development of elements that are required by other entities and the integration process. Component diagrams are used for analysis.\n","5. Information Perspective: The system is described by the amount of known data using static structures. Concerns include data structure, content characteristics, release strategies, format and metadata. Entity-Relationship Diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","6. Patterns Perspective: The system is described as emerging concepts, the collaboration between patterns and abstract roles-connectors. Concerns include the reuse of design patterns, architecture styles and macros for jobs. Structured Composition diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","7. Interface Perspective: Provides information to designers, programmers and users for testing, deteailes the correct use of the services and interfaces not included in the requirements specifications. Each entity has its own set of interface specifications. Concerns include the agreements between designers, programmers, clients and users for collaborative development, simpler integration and easy maintenance. Language definition interface can be used for analysis.\n","8. Structure Perspective: Documentation of internal elements, organization documents of similar elements. Concerns include generic components or the reuse of extremely specific components. Class diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","9. Interaction Perspective: The system is described as the strategies between entities, their time, place, implementation and level. Concerns include responsabilities, application of design patterns and integration description in terms of messages. Sequential diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","10. Dynamic States Perspective: Defines reactive systems with a bounded behavior. Concerns include dynamic systems transitions and reactions to different events. State diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","11. Algorithmic Perspective: Detials operations, internal details and entity logic. Concerns include details for developers and analysts about performance and logical processing. Warnier diagrams can be used for analysis.\n","12. Resources Perspective: Detail the characteristics and usage of the resources of the design object. Concerns include resource reuse, retention, availability and performance. Object Constraint language in UML can be used for analysis.\n","\n","***\n","\n","Structural Descriptions (Static View) are methods used to describe the main components and their interconnections:\n","\n","* Class and Object Diagrams\n","* Component Diagrams\n","* Entity- Relationship Diagrams\n","* Interface Description Diagrams\n","* Structure Graphs: Program calling structure.\n","* Deployment Diagrams: Nodes and relationships for software modeling.\n","* Collaboration Class Cards: Component names, responsabilities and collaboration.\n","* Architecture Description Language (ADL):\n","    * Describe architecture in terms of components and connectos.\n","    * Create, interpret and analyze architecture descriptions.\n","    * Stablish shareholder communities.\n","    * International standard for tools and models.\n","    * Operation between multiple projects and organizations.\n","\n","Important ADL properties include Composition, Abstraction, Reuse, Configuration, Heterogeneity and Analysis.

ISO 25010 defines the following attributes: Functionality, Performance, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintenance, Portability, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Satisfaction, Security, Risk Free and Coverage.\n","\n","***\n","\n","**Activity 5**\n","\n","1. Develop a detailed description of ISO 25010 (35733).\n","2. Provide a summary of each concept.\n","3. Make a conceptual map.\n","\n","***\n","\n","1. Reusability: Ability of the software to be used in a different application. Use of a module or entire application to develop a new one and Development of the module or application in a way that it can be used in future projects.\n","2. Cohesion: Measurement of the degree of association between elements of a module. Can be coincidence, logical, temporal, procedural, communication, sequential or functional cohesion.\n","3. Coupling: Measurement of dependency between module elements. Can be content, shared, external, controlled, structured, data and message coupling.\n","\n","Refactoring seeks to reorganize a program without changing its behavior for better structure and maintenance. For refactoring we need clear code that can be tested, the removal of redundant code, incremental changes and the transformation of monoliths to microservices.\n","\n","Architectural patterns include fundamentals (mudball, unitary, client-server), layers, pipe, microkernel, services, event driven and microservices.\n","\n","1. Mudball: No defined structure, simply describes coding with event handlers bound to the databse directly.\n","2. Unitary: Unique specifications, hardware and software is developed for a particular system with specific purpose features.\n","3. Client-server: Front-end and back-end communication, one is run by the client and the other by a remote server.\n","4. Layers: Horizontal layers where each layer has a specific role within the application. For example, presentation, business, persistance and database layers. There are topographic variants of this pattern.\n","5. Pipelines: Pattern suitable for structuring functionality into discrete parts. Tubes act as communication channels with unidirectional or point to point modes and little data. Between pipes there are self-contained and stateless filters:\n","    1. Producer: Only output, system boot, also known as the source.\n","    2. Transformer: Executes the transformation of some data.\n","    3. Test: Performs test to produce the correct output.\n","    4. Consumer: Terminal point of the data such as displaying the results.\n","6. Microkernel: Used for monolothic architectures such as third party packages, its devided into the core system and the external connectors or plugins. The core or kernel is the minimum functionality required to run the system. The components add functionality making it more stable and simpler to maintain.\n","7. Services: Based on a distributed selection of services to process a large amount of information and a monolithic database. A remote access protocol is necessary (REST) for the interface to access the services, locator patterns can be used to access the interface locally and the database is usually centralized.\n","8. Event Driven: Used to produce high performance scalable applications, useful for small and large projects. Based on the decomposition of asynchronous events that recieve and process data. Usually follow a request based model around an orchestrator (interface, API or services layer).\n","9. Microservices: Fine grained services and information protocls that are light, for example Kubernetes. Service components can vary in granularity for convenience. \n","\n","| Category | Pattern |\n","| :---: | :---: |\n","| Communication | Broker |\n","| Communication | Message Bus |\n","| Communication | Services |\n","| Release | Client-Server |\n","| Release | Microservices |\n","| Release | N Tier |\n","| Structural | Layer Based |\n","| Structural | Component Based |\n","| Structural | Pipelines |\n","| Structural | Object Oriented |\n","| Interactive | Model-View-Controller |\n","| Interactive | Presentation Abstraction Control |\n","| Adaptative | Microkernel |\n","| Adaptative | Reflection |"],"metadata":{"id":"Jp2tPv5DAX6M"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Proyect Web Development ##"],"metadata":{"id":"B890RAjPyZKV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A programming paradigm is the way of programming for software development.
